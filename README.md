## API Information

This application fetches drink data from "TheCocktailDB" API. The API endpoint used is `https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?f=a`. The application limits the retrieved data to the first 50 drinks that start with the letter 'a'.

- To prevent memory leaks, the application clears the interval when the user interacts with the carousel or views the recipe details.
- The application uses CSS for styling and animations.
